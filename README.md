Origins Minus is a collection of origins designed to replace the built-in set.

Included origins are short and sweet, with no scrolling.           
Low-impact origins have no drawbacks, while mid-impact origins have some limitations.

There's less to fret over while picking an origin, and less to remember when loading a save - or switching with [Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy)!

## Design

<details>

### Optionality

Origin powers are all designed to be opt-in. Whenever you remember what origin you're playing, you get to press a few buttons and do a few cool things. 

If you forget for hours on end - it's no big deal! If you can forget something and be screwed over by it - we call that a bug.

### Ambiguity

All origins are intended to be ambiguous as to what creature, species, profession, or character they might be referring to. We want you to fill in the gaps yourself - with what you want to be playing!

Keep this in mind when picking an origin - just because the Avian's icon is a feather, doesn't mean it's not a mech suit!

[Tinkerer's Statures](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures) can expand this further by adding size variation!

We've provided a list of examples for themes for each origin to help players choose.

### Building and Multiplayer

Minus is built with multiplayer in mind - origins move through and interact with the world in visually distinct ways, and (if you like) build visually distinct homes and functional structures to match!

Blink points, water/lava lifts, gliding and vine whip pads, rappel points, rescue moats, and blood farms are all encouraged emergent gameplay. 

Have fun making your builds origin (and [Stature](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures)) accessible!

### Balance

These origins aren't designed to be balanced compared to the vanilla game, nor to the built-in origins, and not even compared to eachother. They're only designed to be balanced to themselves - as being fun to play.

We tweak and rebalance origins when they fully disengage an unintended part of the game - like being unable to die in combat on normal difficulty - not for power comparisons.

## Further Info

### Versions

If you'd prefer the datapack version for any reason, you can [download it from the repo](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/origins-minus/tree/main/src/main/resources) (Direct Download Link)

As of `v1.7.1` origins works out of the box with Quilt.           
On 1.18.2, you'll have to add a [quilt version of calio](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/raw/quilt_1.18.2/mods/Calio-1.18.2-1.6.0.jar) as a workaround.

Not tested with older versions of origins.

### Credits

Many origins are adapted with permission from Origins Plus by [Dan's Other Clone](https://www.youtube.com/c/DansOtherClone/videos) - Hence the name!

### Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about ease of play and self-expression.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
