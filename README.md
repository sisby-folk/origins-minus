Origins Minus is a collection of origins designed to replace the built-in set.

Included origins are short and sweet, with no scrolling.           
Low-impact origins have no drawbacks, while mid-impact origins have some limitations.

There's less to fret over while picking an origin, and less to remember when loading a save - or switching with [Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy)!

## Design

<details>
<summary>Click to show Design Notes</summary>

### Optionality

Origin powers are all designed to be opt-in. Whenever you remember what origin you're playing, you get to press a few buttons and do a few cool things. 

If you forget for hours on end - it's no big deal! If you can forget something and be screwed over by it - we call that a bug.

### Ambiguity

All origins are intended to be ambiguous as to what creature, species, profession, or character they might be referring to. We want you to fill in the gaps yourself - with what you want to be playing!

Keep this in mind when picking an origin - just because the Avian's icon is a feather, doesn't mean it's not a mech suit!

[Tinkerer's Statures](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures) can expand this further by adding size variation!

We've provided a list of examples for themes for each origin to help players choose.

### Building and Multiplayer

Minus is built with multiplayer in mind - origins move through and interact with the world in visually distinct ways, and (if you like) build visually distinct homes and functional structures to match!

Blink points, water/lava lifts, gliding and vine whip pads, rappel points, rescue moats, and blood farms are all encouraged emergent gameplay. 

Have fun making your builds origin (and [Stature](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures)) accessible!

### Balance

These origins aren't designed to be balanced compared to the vanilla game, nor to the built-in origins, and not even compared to eachother. They're only designed to be balanced to themselves - as being fun to play.

We tweak and rebalance origins when they fully disengage an unintended part of the game - like being unable to die in combat on normal difficulty - not for power comparisons.

## Further Info

### Versions

2.0 on origins forge (and minecraft versions before 1.19.2) may be unstable and contain powers that don't function correctly.

The datapack version is available in the changelog of each version, or you can manually download it from source.

As of `v1.7.1` origins works out of the box with Quilt.           
On 1.18.2, you'll have to add a [quilt version of calio](https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-quilt/raw/quilt_1.18.2/mods/Calio-1.18.2-1.6.0.jar) as a workaround.

### Credits

Many origins are adapted with permission from Origins Plus by [Dan's Other Clone](https://www.youtube.com/c/DansOtherClone/videos) - Hence the name!

### Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about ease of play and self-expression.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
